  "Before starting this course, I worked as an electrian for my dad's comapny doing mostly commercial jobs. Ive also worked in banking for several years before that. I love anything outdoors but I'm not a huge fan of the cold! I love playing sports and try to travel as much as possible. Ive actually fairly recently returned from PNG and got to spend 3 months in the jungles getting to know the people there. Being in a third world country put a lot of things into perspective and also made me realize how truly lucky we are to live in America. One of the biggest things I've learned in life is to never take anything for granted and always strive to be better! I have no experiance in this profession but I am excited to learn and enjoy a challenge"
